- The alphabets extracted from the string can be stored as bit patterns
- Representing the process of selecting n out of 26 alphabets using a recursive function 
  - Instead of combinations, ensuring a fixed time complexity.
  - Hint: The number of alphabets is fixed at 26.
- Using bitwise operators to compare whether a given set of alphabets can form a specific word
