### Optimal Food Combinations: Minimizing Cost, Maximizing Nutrition
It was difficult to determine the minimum combination of nutrients.
I need to see if there's a way to simplify the logic of finding the minimum value.

### use struct (of cpp)
```cpp
// simplified form (defining `Food` and declaring `food` simultaneously)
struct Food{
	int mp, mf, ms, mv, cost; 
} food[16]; 
```

```cpp
struct Food{
	int mp, mf, ms, mv, cost; 
}; 
Food food[16]; 
```
