# Handling Prev and Next Values in Recursion

As you can see from the code, there is no reason to access a[i + 1] inside the function. 
The value of a[i] already corresponds to the 'next'(compared to the index i) value, and the parameters l and r represent the previous values.
(It might have been less confusing if the timing was noted in the variable names beforehand.)
This part needs to be considered in advance.
