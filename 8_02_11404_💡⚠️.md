‚ö†Ô∏è Order of iteration in triple for-loops: k -> i -> j or k -> j -> i (k must come first)

‚ö†Ô∏è When calculating INF + INF, ensure that INF is set low enough so that the sum does not exceed the intended boundary for INF (e.g., use a value less than $\mathrm{INT\_MAX} / 2$).

üí° Initializing a 2D array: `fill(&adj[0][0], &adj[0][0] + (101 * 101), INF);`
