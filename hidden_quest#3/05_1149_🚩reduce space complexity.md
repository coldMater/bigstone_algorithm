# Tabulation VS Memoization

- Top-down (memoization): You don't have to calculate every state.
- Bottom-up (tabulation): You have to calculate every state.
- The problem at https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1149 is an excellent example for practicing bottom-up (tabulation) dynamic programming.
- The RGB Distance problem is almost designed to discourage the use of top-down DP,
  and top-down only makes sense when you can skip certain states.

# When Top-down vs Bottom-up DP Makes Sense

| Condition                            | Top-down | Bottom-up |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | --------- |
| All states are used                  | ❌       | ✅        |
| Linear transition (i → i+1)          | ❌       | ✅        |
| Graph-like transitions               | ✅       | ❌        |
| Early termination / pruning possible | ✅       | ❌        |
| Easy space optimization (O(1))       | ❌       | ✅        |
| Easier debugging & traceability      | ❌       | ✅        |

- Top-down DP shines when you can skip states or prune the search space.
- Bottom-up DP is better when all states are inevitably visited in a simple order.
