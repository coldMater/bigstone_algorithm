I encountered this problem while studying dynamic programming (DP). 
Since I wasn't very familiar with DP at the time, I attempted to approach the problem only using DP methods. 
However, I couldn't find a solution using this approach. (I initially overcomplicated things.)

Instead, I thought, "Even though it's obvious that it will likely time out, let's at least try to pass the examples."
Surprisingly, after finding the solution this way, the DP approach became apparent.

Therefore, if it seems like there's no way to solve the problem using a specific method(in this case DP), it's often helpful to start by brute-forcing it. This can reveal the appropriate approach.
