The time complexity could potentially be $2^{40}$. Let's think about why. Because N could have a maximum value of 20, and each row (up to 20 rows) can either be reversed or not. Additionally, for each case, each column (up to 20 columns) could also be reversed or not. Therefore, the result would be $2^{20} \times 2^{20}$.

⚠️ Note: Always consider the time complexity before solving the problem.

$2^{40}$ is an enormous number. Therefore, a brute force approach cannot be the solution. This is why an alternative approach (problem-solving methodology as an algorithm) is necessary.

I realized through time complexity analysis that the brute-force approach was inappropriate. This illustrates an example of how time complexity analysis can provide a useful guide( (implying the need to reduce time complexity) for selecting problem-solving approaches.

### Utilizing Integer Variables as Boolean Arrays
*Bitwise Manipulation and Contextual Interpretation, Boolean arrays can be represented as single numbers*

If $N = 4$, each set of 4 bits (as mentioned in the problem, representing the number of coins in a row or column) corresponds to a single row. For instance, a row like THTT can be represented as 1011 (with T as 1 and H as 0). As illustrated above, this forms a boolean array [1, 0, 1, 1]. Consequently, we can express it as a single integer number, treating the array indices as place values. It becomes 13, as indicated by $(1 \times 2^0, 0 \times 2^1, 1 \times 2^2, 1 \times 2^3)$.

We can assign this number to a variable and use the bitwise NOT operator to reverse every bit.
```cpp
int a = 13; // 0b1101, representing the boolean array [1, 0, 1, 1]
int reversed = ~a; // 0b0010, representing the boolean array [0, 1, 0, 0]

cout << reversed; // Actually -14. The binary 0b0010 equals 2 in decimal. So, what's happening?
```
In reality, an int variable consists of 32 bits in total. When the bitwise NOT operator is applied to an int variable, all 32 bits are inverted. This is the reason why the output of ~a is -14, instead of the desired 2. However, in the specific context of our problem (limited to this particular scenario, not a general rule), it represents 2.

Although ~a outputs -14, this doesn't mean we can't use this variable as a boolean array. While the output of this variable is still -14, we can effectively treat only the last four bits (corresponding to the given value of N) as a boolean array. We can consider just the last four bits to be relevant, regardless of the variable's entire bit representation. Therefore, regardless of the actual value of the variable, we can treat only the last four bits as a boolean array.

You can perform bitwise operations on an int variable, and due to the ability to specify the number of bits to utilize within an int variable, interpreting -14 as 2 (according to our context) is feasible. This is because we can consider -14 as equivalent to 2 when only considering the relevant bits (such as [0, 1, 0, 0] or 0b0010) in our interpretation.

```cpp
int a = 13 // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001101, output as 13
int i = ~a // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110010, output as -14
```
Regardless of how long the bit sequence is, as long as we observe and control only the last four bits we desire, we can effectively utilize an int variable like a boolean array.


### Calculate Number of Possibilities Using Only Either a Column or a Row
Keep in mind that the objective of this problem is to find the case with the minimum number of tails (T). Using a brute-force methodology, a time complexity of $2^{40}$ is unavoidable. As we examine above, we have $2^{20}$ possibilities for columns and $2^{20}$ for rows.

If we decide to start with the columns, we can use a permutation with repetition approach for the columns. In a specific case, we should apply the same permutation with repetition approach to the rows as well.

However, another approach is required to reduce the time complexity. Do we need to apply the same permutation with repetition approach to the rows when it's applied only to the columns in a specific case? No, our objective is to find the case with the minimum T, so there's no need to consider every single case.Thus, in a specific column-fixed case, we only need to consider whether each row needs to be flipped or not, in order to minimize the number of tails. The time complexity, which was originally O(2^N), has now been reduced to a mere O(N).
