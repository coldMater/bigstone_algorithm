The price of an individual jewel can be up to 100,000,000. The data type "Integer" can handle a maximum value of approximately 2,100,000,000. However, considering that the number of jewels can potentially reach 300,000, the total price of the jewels that can be stored in a bag may exceed the upper limit of the "Integer" type. Therefore, the data type of the final price of the jewels must be "long long."
