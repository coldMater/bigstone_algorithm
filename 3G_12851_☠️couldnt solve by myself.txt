# Key Point 1: Boundary condition
The maximum length of the array and the maximum index of the array are different.
If the max length is 20, the max index of the array is 19.
If you want to use the index of the array as a natural number, the length of the array must be set to N + 1 or greater.
In this problem (3G_12851), the range of Subin's position is from 0 to 100,000. So, the total number of elements in the array is 100,001.
As a consequence, the length of the visited array must be set as v[100,001].

# Key Point 2: Paths can be counted within the BFS algorithm
Initially, I used BFS to find the shortest time, and then attempted to find the actual paths using a recursive function.
However, this approach took too long to execute. After reviewing the solution, I noticed that the paths were counted within the BFS algorithm itself.
Due to the requirement of finding the shortest paths, the counting was done before pushing the elements into the queue.
However, I currently find it unclear and believe that I need to take some time to understand it more thoroughly.
