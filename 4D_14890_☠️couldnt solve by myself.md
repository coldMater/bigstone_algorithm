### 1st Problem - Overthinking It: Making Things Too Complicated
It was a simple implementation problem, but I overthought it at times. For example, I tried to check all possible placements of the ramps, which made it more complex than necessary.

### 2nd Problem - Struggling to Simplify Complex Logic
When I looked at the solution, it was just represented with a single 'for' loop and three 'if' statements. However, even after confirming it was an implementation problem, I still found myself thinking about complex branches. I was convinced that solving the problem in the way I had in mind would result in a large and complicated branching structure, so I ended up referring to the solution.
