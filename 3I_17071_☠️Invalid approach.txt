Since Subin can move by +1 or -1 at each turn, 
if at any moment Brother's position becomes the same as a location Subin had visited before,
and the time difference between Subin's visit and Brother's visit is even, 
then they are considered to have met.


For example, 
if Subin visited the location 8 at 10 seconds, and Brother reached the location 8 at 14 seconds, then they can meet at 14 seconds. 
This is because Subin can move to the location 9 at 11 seconds (+1), to the location 10 at 12 seconds (+1),
back to the location 9 at 13 seconds (-1), and finally to the location 8 at 14 seconds (-1).

If the time difference between Subin's visit and Brother's visit is odd, they cannot meet at that point.  

--- 3rd try wrong point
Subin can approach some point at even or odd time. We can consider multiple paths for Subin's position to move from 5 to 11.
ex1. 5 -> 10 -> 11 (It takes 2 units of time)
ex2. 5 -> 6 -> 12 -> 11 (It takes 3 units of time)
Subin's time taken to reach a specific point can be odd or even as shown in the example above.

So, both histories must be recorded. It says we need a visited array for odd times and another for even times.
