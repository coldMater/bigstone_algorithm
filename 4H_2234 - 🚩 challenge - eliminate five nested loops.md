```cpp
  for (int y = 0; y < M; ++y) {
    for (int x = 0; x < N; ++x) {
      for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        memset(visited, 0, sizeof(visited));
        int temp = m[y][x] ;
        m[y][x] = (m[y][x] & ~(1 << i));
        for (int yy = 0; yy < M; ++yy) {
          for (int xx = 0; xx < N; ++xx) {
            if (visited[yy][xx]) continue;
            mrs = max(mrs, dfs(yy, xx));
          }
        }
        m[y][x] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
```
The code I provided above is intended to determine the maximum size of a room when one wall is removed. However, it appears to be inefficient due to the inclusion of five nested for statements.

Initially, during the first flood fill, the visited map can be populated with room numbers. While traversing each cell, if the right cell of a particular cell has a different room number, it indicates that the wall between them can collapse. Similarly, the same rule applies to the cell below. By utilizing just a double for loop in this manner, it becomes possible to assess whether the wall between two rooms can collapse.

Additionally, by storing the size of each room in an array during the initial flood fill, it becomes possible to calculate the maximum room size simply by adding the sizes of the two different rooms when a wall between them collapses. This eliminates the need for further DFS (depth-first search) after the wall collapse.
