To avoid confusion, keep the following points in mind:

- Until reaching the termination condition of the `find` function, treat `M` as the length itself.
- At the termination condition, pay attention to converting between length and index to find the n-th character of the given string.
- The values in the `l` array (which stores the length of the string at each step) represent the 'length', so no additional conversion is needed when comparing with the 'n-th character'.
